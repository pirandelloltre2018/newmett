Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho claimed Liverpool never tested David de Gea on the second-half of Saturday's 2-1 win.

Marcus Rashford hit a first-half double to create the gain, though Liverpool dominated following the break after an Eric Bailly own goal let them back into the game.

Mourinho reasoned afterwards: "We were quite aggressive in the initially half, we wished to have control of the game, spaces for transition and make an effort to exploit - certainly not weaknesses - but points where the opponent is certainly not so good.

"The second one half it was certainly not our intention to be as defensive as we had been

Liverpool pushed us back but We don't remember the probabilities that require David de Gea to make the goal safe and sound. I don't bear in mind a dangerous situation to your goal. It was control by them getting the ball and control by us without the ball. I believe we deserved the three details."""

On Paul Pogba's absence, he added: "He was injured in the last minute of the previous training session before the game. Incredible. EASILY finished working out session about a minute before he would have been OK."
