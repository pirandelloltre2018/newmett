Southampton youngster Kornelius Hansen has responded to recommendations that he could possibly be sold to Liverpool, admitting he would make the move however, not celebrate if he scored against Manchester United. 

Saints swooped to snap up the Norwegian attacker found in the summer of 2017 and he quickly began to make an impact found in the youth ranks.

He was praised by Under-18s boss Craig Flemming, who lauded his top quality.

Just 16 years good old, Hansen has featured on a regular basis for the Under-18s and also got onto the bench for an EFL Trophy clash against Cambridge United, in another sign of how highly thought of he is at Southampton.

Southampton have regularly sold players to Liverpool in recent years, with centre-rear Virgil van Dijk the latest to help make the move, in January.

And the Norway Under-17 international was asked what his response is always to an offer from Liverpool, especially considering he's a Manchester United supporter.

That's the challenge of using for Southampton, suddenly I'm for sale to Liverpool, he joked to TV2.

I'd have gone there, but I'd not need celebrated against United.
Hansen linked up with Southampton from Norwegian third tier club Fram Larvik.

Former England supervisor Sven-Goran Eriksson has been associated with launching a good bid to get the golf club, with Swedish sides restricting ownership to 49 %, forcing the Swede to glance across the border.
