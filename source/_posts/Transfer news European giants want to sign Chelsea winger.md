Winger Kenedy’s loan proceed to Newcastle United is panning out very well indeed. Since moving to St. James’ Recreation area inin January, he possesses started all of their eight Premier League games, documenting 2 goals and 2 assists so far. His best functionality arrived last month at home against Southamptin, where he obtained a brace that included a wonderful solo effort. He alss create a late champion for Ayoze Perez against Huddersfield fourteen days ago. The Magpies will be on a work of 3 successive wins, and also have climbed up to 10th in the desk.

Transfer news

His work have caught the attention of two European juggernauts in particular. Relating to Sky Activities, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain could be considering signing him come early july, if we are prepared to sell. A whole host of Premier League clubs happen to be also reportedly courting the 22 year-old.

Signed right from Fluminense in 2015, Kenedy was presented with his chance in the first-year by Jose Mourinho. Despite traditionally being a winger, he was deployed as a left-again. He went on to make 20 appearances in all competitions and scored 2 goals.

Under Antonio Conte, his chances have been limited to cup video games. Despite impressing in a number of of these, he hasn’t gained the Italian’s confidence to replace Marcos Alonso at kept wing-back. His blistering pace and crossing potential should ideally make him well-appropriate for the role, but Conte has already established other ideas.

Transfer news

In line with the report, zero formal bid has been submitted by any club yet, and Kenedy could wait to hang in there and see who have our up coming manager is, before selecting to watch out for pastures new.
We’ve seen the likes of Mohamed Salah, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku flourish elsewhere, after we’ve deemed them “not good enough”. Could Kenedy be considered a similar case? Judging by his performances for Newcastle so far, and since Bayern are considering him as a replacement for Arjen Robben or Franck Ribery, he very well could be.
