After spending over £70 million on the duo of Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater previous summer, it looks like we will be at it again come early july. Central midfield continues to be a issue at Stamford Bridge, with Bakayoko flopping badly up to now, and Drinkwater hardly getting a game.

According to French supply L’Equipe, we're able to target Fine midfielder Jean-Michel Seri in the summertime. The Ivorian provides been an exceptionally consistent performer in Ligue 1 in the last three periods, and is also becoming courted by Manchester City. He will be available for £34.8 million in the upcoming transfer window, when his release clause will get activated.

N’Golo Kante provides been our only consistent player at the heart of the recreation area this season. Bakayoko provides flopped badly, Drinkwater features hardly played frequently, and Ross Barkley provides either been enjoyed out of location or out with harm since joining from Everton in January. That’s practically £100 million spent on player who hardly appear to be being long-term solutions at the golf club. Cesc Fabregas can’t play every single video game in a double-pivot, and is especially found out when we’re outnumbered for the reason that area of the pitch. Targeting Seri makes sense, as we desire a box-to-field midfielder who can also contribute directly to goals. The Fine man has only scored once in every competitions this year, but did find the back of the web seven times this past year.

Also, Drinkwater keeps growing more and more frustrated with having less playing time, and may ask for a move immediately after just one season in West London. In line with the Telegraph, the Englishman’s hope of making the World Glass squad later this season is under extreme doubt, after hardly featuring this year. Drinkwater has simply started 5 Premier League games so far, scoring once. News folks monitoring Seri have further threatened his placement in the medial side. The player is gradually needs to question if this is a bit too big a maneuver for him, after signing from Leicester Metropolis in the summertime for £35 million.
The Telegraph report also states that Monaco may be ready to re-sign  Bakayoko in the summertime, but we will probably give him a bit more time to adjust to the English game. So far, he features been among our worst signings in new memory, but Antonio Conte has trapped with him again and again. Only time will tell if he'll come great, and replicate the proper execution he confirmed for the French champions previous season.
